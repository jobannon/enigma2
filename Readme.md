      <td>Project includes a module and/or superclass that could be used outside of the Enigma project. All methods are less than 8 lines of code, all classes are less than 100 lines, and all lines of code are less than 80 characters. At least one class demonstrates a good use of class methods. Variable and method names always clearly communicate purpose.</td>
      <td>Project is broken into logical components consisting of at least 4 classes that have single responsibilities. No more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines. No class is longer than 100 lines. While there may be 1 or 2 lapses, variable and method names clearly communicate purpose.<strong> *************** 4 classes are present.  No more than two methods are longer than 7 true lines.  Variable names and methods are commonsense oriented and classes follow SRP. </strong> </td>
      <td>Project is broken into logical components that include 2 or 3 classes that have single responsibilities. No more than 4 methods are longer than 7 lines. One class may be longer than 100 lines. Several variables or methods have a purpose that is not immediately obvious due to poor naming.</td>
      <td>Project is not broken into logical components. 0 or 1 classes demonstrate single responsibility. More than 4 methods are longer than 7 lines. Variables and methods often have a purpose that is not immediately obvious due to poor naming.</td>

      <td>Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.<strong> *************** 100 percent coverage per simplecov.  Most major functionality was built with a test first.  Runner was tested in pry </strong> </td>
      <td>Every method is not tested. git history does not demonstrate students are writing tests before implementation code.</td>
      <td>Less than half of the methods in any given class are untested or have tests that donâ€™t verify expected behavior.</td>

      <td>At least 30 commits. At least 10 pull requests. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.<strong> *************** 40 commits.  A few maybe less than clear.  A few pull requests were murky, but mostly to the point.  Have a pull request template in place to emphasize understanding </strong></td>
      <td>20 - 30 commits. 5 - 9 pull requests. No more than 5 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.</td>
